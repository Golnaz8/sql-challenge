## Overview 

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your first major assignment is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the company’s historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. The only records available from this period are contained in six CSV files.

This project involves several key steps:
1. Data Modeling: Designing relational database tables to structure and store the data effectively.
2. Data Engineering: Importing the CSV data into a SQL database, ensuring data integrity and alignment with the relational model.
3. Data Analysis: Querying the database to answer targeted questions about the employees, their roles, departments, and other relevant details.

Through this project, you’ll apply fundamental skills in database design, data transformation, and SQL query writing to uncover insights from historical employee data.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **SQL**: Used for querying, manipulating, and analyzing data within the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system (RDBMS) selected to create, store, and manage the structured data imported from CSV files.
- **pgAdmin**: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing PostgreSQL databases, executing SQL queries, and visualizing database schema and data.
- **Quick Database Diagrams**: Utilized to create the data model, visually representing the relationships between tables and helping design the database structure.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.

## Instructions for Importing Data:
For the COPY commands in this script to work, replace this path with the full path to your CSV file. For example:

On Windows: C:/Users/YourUsername/path/to/SQL-CHALLENGE/EmployeeSQL/Resources/employees.csv
On Mac/Linux: /Users/YourUsername/path/to/SQL-CHALLENGE/EmployeeSQL/Resources/employees.csv
Alternatively, you can use the import feature in pgAdmin to manually load the data.
